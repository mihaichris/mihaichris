# Hello there üëã

My name is Mihai Fagadau (he/his) and I am a PHP engineer üêò / contractor / freelancer with 5+ years of experience,
passionate about Linux, Semantic Web and Search engines. I'm also trying to contribute more to open source, and I
started working on my own libraries. My work of interests are finance and ecommerce applications.

ü§ù I thoroughly enjoy working on experimental applications, and I started working on small side projects.
If coders had a style, I'd say mine is minimalist and/or indie.
